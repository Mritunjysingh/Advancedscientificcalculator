The Scientific Calculator project aims to develop an advanced calculator capable of performing complex scientific computations. The calculator will be implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL) using Java, and it will provide a wide range of mathematical functionalities, including trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponential functions, complex number operations, and statistical calculations. Additionally, the project will involve integrating a history management system to track and store the last 50 calculations in a SQL Server or MySQL database.
Mathematical Functions:
Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, and their inverses.
Logarithmic Functions: Natural logarithm (ln), logarithm base 10 (log10), and custom base logarithms.
Exponential Functions: Exponentiation (e^x), power functions, and square roots.
Complex Number Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and conversion between polar and rectangular forms.
Statistical Functions: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.
History Management:

Calculation History: The calculator will track the last 50 calculations performed by the user.
Database Integration: Calculation history will be stored in a SQL Server or MySQL database, allowing for easy retrieval and management.
Persistence: Historical data will persist between sessions, ensuring users can access previous calculations even after closing and reopening the application.
